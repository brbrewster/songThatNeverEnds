I am the type of person who changes the default sound events in Windows
95/98/NT all the time.  I'll spend several hours each month downloading
various .WAV files from the internet.

However, some times I'll forget what's in a particular .WAV file and I'll
want to listen to it.  Since I am a DOS/CMD prompt kind of guy and most
.WAV players are GUI apps, I wrote WAV to play a single WAV file from a
command prompt.  It's also useful in batch files.

Thanks to Lockergnome and ZdNet, WAV has been very popular.  Many of you
emailed me requesting that I allow you to abort a .WAV file by pressing the
Esc key.  So, I've added that feature.  And since I had to switch from using
the ever simplistic sndPlaySound() API call to mciSendString(), I also added
the ability to play any audio file supported by Windows.  And, I've added a
"/Q" command line switch to prevent WAV from displaying my copyright
information and the name of the file it's playing.  This should help make your
batch files prettier.

With version 2.2, you can now specify the number of times you'd like to
repeat a WAV or MIDI file using the "/R" command line switch.

With version 2.4, you can now play any audio file supported by Windows.  If
you download the latest version of the Windows Media Player from Microsoft
(www.microsoft.com/windows/mediaplayer/) you can use WAV to play Wav Audio
(.WAV), Midi (.MID, .RMI), MP3 Audio (.MP3), and others.

Version 2.4 also fixes a bug...  You can now play files with long filenames
and embedded spaces.

With version 2.5, you can control the volume using the "/V" command line
switch:

  /V100 is 100% or full volume
  /V50  is 50% or half volume
  /V0   is 0% or complete silence

With version 2.51, an error level is now returned if WAV is unable to play a
file.

With version 2.65 if you specify -1 in the /R option, the media file will play
continuosly until ESC is pressed.
