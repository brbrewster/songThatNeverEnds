# songThatNeverEnds

This Windows command script plays the song that never ends via a command window. It was originally made for XP, but I have tested it on Windows 10, and it seemed to work fine.

It goes througn the song; showng only one line in the command window at a time. As it shows each line, it uses the WAV.exe command line WAV player to play that same line; purposely sung off tune.

When it gets to the end, it repeats on an endless loop.

It's intended to be used as a non-destructive prank program. 

Imagine copying this to somebody's Windows computer, pointing their most frequently used shortcut to SongThatNeverEnds.bat, and then watching their reaction when it runs.
